    <h3 id="degrees">Degrees:</h3>
    <p>
        Niko studied at the University of Cuteness and Fluffiness in Catifornia, 
        obtaining his Ownt degree at the age of 22 hours of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        He completed his master's degree in Fur Coloration at the age of 1 week, studying 
        in depth the topic "bicolor cat whiskers" at the same University from which 
        he graduated.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment, Niko is studying at the University of Kind Animals, in Nepaw, working on 
        his doctorate which focuses on the study of "undercoat and huggability level", 
        at the age of 3, and does not intend to stop his studies there.

    </ul>
    <h3 id="dates">Dates:</h3>
    <p>
        Because the passage of time is relative even for humans, let alone cats, Nikon was 
        unable to place his great achievements and the dates of his diplomas according to the 
        Gregorian calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to realize the fact that all of Niko's achievements occurred between 
        September 9, 2021 and the present. As little time as it may seem to the ignorant eyes of 
        human beings, Niko is already considered a young adult among cats. His achievements are 
        considerable, and greatly admired by those who wish to follow the same path as Niko.
